/// this time. I get the feeling that an even more "Unity" like way to 
/// implement this example would be to add a RigidBody2d to VectorBall and then
/// apply forces to the VectorBall. This seems like overkill in non-physics 
/// based games and in simple cases like this.
/// 
/// Again, this script is shorter than the Processing version because it relies
/// on Unity.
